# insights-results-smart-proxy

Smart proxy for insights results

## Description

Insights Results Smart Proxy is a service that acts as a proxy between the different external
data pipeline clients and the different services providing the required information.

It provides access to the [Insights Results Aggregator](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-results-aggregator)
and to the [Insights Content Service](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-content-service),
providing the clients with different endpoints for accesing both report results and rule content metadata
from a single service.
